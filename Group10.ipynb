Take the semi-major axis a = 1 and total mass m = 1. Make the ellipse have an eccentricity of e = 0.5 so that x0 = (1 + e)a = 1.5a. Do each integration for a range of step sizes h =h0, h0/2, h0/4, . . . h0/1024, where h0 = 0.1 T with T being the expected orbital period. Plot the error in the energy as a function of h.
